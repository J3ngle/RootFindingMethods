In this report we look to solve particular types of root finding problems. Root problems have specific importance and interesting results in the field of Numerical Analysis. We move to discuss the implementation and validation of three theoretical root finding tests, the Bisection, Newtons, and Fixed point methods respectively. For our discussion we compare the convergence speed of finding the root with these methods as well as some potential advantages and disadvantages for each of the methods. Figures and tables are shown for visual aid in to the theoretical results discussed in class.
